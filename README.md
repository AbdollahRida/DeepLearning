# Deep Learning
Highly inspired by the amazing pytorch-based course by [M. Lelarge](https://mlelarge.github.io/dataflowr-web/) I took at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), this repo contains all the ideas/notebooks/projects I have worked on during the duration of the course. I will of course push additionnal content as my mastery of Deep Learning grows.

## Logistic Regression (WIP):

This is a very simple implementation of the Logistic Regression algorithme using Pytorch. I will work on it to make more modular.
