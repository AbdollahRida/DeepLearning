# Deep Learning
Highly inspired by the amazing pytorch-based course by [M. Lelarge](https://mlelarge.github.io/dataflowr-web/) I took at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), this repo contains all the ideas/notebooks/projects I have worked on during the duration of the course. I will of course push additionnal content as my mastery of Deep Learning grows.

## Logistic Regression (WIP):

This is a very simple implementation of the Logistic Regression algorithme using Pytorch. I will work on it to make more modular.

## RGAN

This folder contains pytorch code inpired by the paper _[Real-valued (Medical) Time Series Generation with Recurrent Conditional GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02633)_, by Stephanie L. Hyland* ([@corcra](https://github.com/corcra)), Cristóbal Esteban* ([@cresteban](https://github.com/cresteban)), and Gunnar Rätsch ([@ratsch](https://github.com/ratsch)), from the Ratschlab, also known as the [Biomedical Informatics](http://bmi.inf.ethz.ch/) Group at ETH Zurich.
